# quick-menu
**Quick Menu** is a **client-side** mod for Minecraft that adds a **configurable easy-to-access menu** that runs **basic repetitive commands**.<br>
It aims to save you time by giving you a place to put all the commands you may need for a given context.

The mod requires the [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib) modding library and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).<br>
It is also recommended to have [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) installed to access the mods config. *(An alternative way of accessing config is planned)*

## Download
You can download the **latest version** in the [Releases](https://github.com/ImCodist/quick-menu/releases) of this repo.<br>
The mod is also avaliable to download on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quick-menu).

- Easy to access menu with a **keybind** *(Default: G)*
- A simple action button **editor**.
- Each action button can run **as many actions** as you want.
- The **icon** for an action button can be selected with a **dedicated GUI**.

## How to Use
**Open the menu** in-game with the **chosen keybind** *(Default: G)*.<br>
To enter **edit mode** click the pencil icon next to the title.<br>

In **edit mode** you can:
- Create a new action using the button below the main menu.
- Delete an action button by right-clicking the button you'd like to delete.

## TODO
- [ ] Keybinds to activate each button.
- [ ] Group system that can show or hide itself when not active. (Server specific groups)
- [ ] More action types. (Keys, Menus, Timers)
- [ ] More customization options. (Different themes, change button size)
- [ ] Advanced action button options. (Should it close on pressed, run multiple times, toggle on and off)
- [ ] General clean-up (the code is kinda a mess rn)
