# quick-menu
**Quick Menu** is a **client-side** mod for Minecraft that adds a **configurable easy-to-access menu** that runs **basic repetitive commands**.<br>
It aims to save you time by giving you a place to put all the commands you may need for a given context.

The mod requires the [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib) modding library.<br>
It is also recommended to have [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) installed to access the mods config. *(An alternative way of accessing config is planned)*
